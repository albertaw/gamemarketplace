Game Marketplace
===================

Context
-------------------
An online marketplace where players can trade game items for cash or other item with each other.

Problem
-------------------
Items that can be traded are game inventory, game currency, or real money. 
Players can trade items from the same game and from different games. 
Players maintain a "wallet" with their cash and game items. 
There is an exchange that manages all the orders.
To create an order, a seller lists their item for sale along with the asking price. 
When the buyer purchases the item, assets are traded and the order is removed from the exchange. 
A player may also list items that they want to buy and what they are willing to pay.
