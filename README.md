Game Marketplace
===================

Context
-------------------
An online marketplace where players can trade game items with each other.

Problem
-------------------
Items that can be traded are game inventory, game currency, or real money. Players can trade items from the same game and from different games. Players maintain a "wallet" with their cash and game items. To initiate a trade, a seller lists their item for sale along with the asking price. When the buyer purchases the item, the payment is deducted from their wallet and added to the seller's wallet. A player may also list items that they want to buy and what they are willing to pay.
